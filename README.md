Book Recommendation System-https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-ct1u1dlumphs738s9h10/deploys/dep-ct34m8aj1k6c73e2qd30

Overview
The Book Recommendation System is a web application built using Flask. It allows users to explore popular books and receive personalized book recommendations based on their preferences. The project uses Collaborative Filtering for generating recommendations and Fuzzy Search for enhanced user input flexibility.

Features
1. Homepage
Displays the Top 50 Most Popular Books from the dataset.
The books are ranked based on their popularity scores.
2. Book Recommendation
Users can search for books, and the system will recommend the most relevant books using:
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books similar to what the user has searched for, leveraging patterns from other users' interactions.
Fuzzy Search: Handles typos or incomplete inputs to improve user experience.
Technologies Used
Backend:
Flask: Lightweight and versatile web framework.
Python: Core programming language for data processing and logic.
Frontend:
HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap: Used for creating a responsive and visually appealing UI.
Data Processing:
Pandas: For data manipulation and filtering.
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For implementing the Collaborative Filtering algorithm.
FuzzyWuzzy: For implementing Fuzzy Search.
Server:
Gunicorn: Used as the WSGI server for deploying the Flask app.
How It Works
Homepage:

The top 50 books are fetched from a dataset and displayed on the homepage.
Books are ranked by popularity.
Recommendation Logic:

Users enter a book title in the search bar.
The system applies Fuzzy Search to interpret the input, even if it contains typos.
Based on the search query, the Collaborative Filtering algorithm suggests books that align with the user's preferences.
Setup and Deployment
Prerequisites:
Python 3.10 or higher
pip (Python package manager)
Git (optional, for cloning the repository)
Steps to Run Locally:
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Book-Recommendation-System.git
cd Book-Recommendation-System
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
flask run
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Deploying on Render
Use the included Dockerfile for containerized deployment.
Ensure the start command in the Render dashboard is set to:
bash
Copy code
gunicorn app:app
Dataset
The dataset includes information on:

Book titles
Authors
Ratings
Popularity metrics
Source:
[Dataset Source/Link if available]

Future Enhancements
User Login and Profiles: Save user preferences and interaction history.
Advanced Filtering: Add filtering by genre, author, or publication year.
Improved Collaborative Filtering: Incorporate hybrid models using content-based filtering.
Recommendations Dashboard: Provide more visual insights into user preferences and trends.
